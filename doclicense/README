  DESCRIPTION
Support for putting documents under a license.

The doclicense package allows you to put your document under a license and include a link
to read about the license or include an icon or image of the license.
Currently, only Creative Commons is supported but this package is designed to
handle all kinds of licenses.

  GENERATING THE FILES
You can generate the doclicense.sty file with: tex doclicense.ins

The documentation can be generated with:

    pdflatex doclicense.dtx
    makeindex -s gglo.ist -o doclicense.gls doclicense.glo
    makeindex -s gind doclicense
    pdflatex doclicense.dtx
    thumbpdf doclicense
    pdflatex doclicense.dtx

Note that this will only work when this directory is below your
$TEXMFHOME tree (unless the doclicense package is already installed
for example by your TeX distribution). Example for doing this manually:

    mkdir --parents ~/texmf/tex/latex/ && cd ~/texmf/tex/latex/
    git clone https://github.com/ypid/latex-packages.git ypid-latex-packages
    cd ypid-latex-packages/doclicense && make build
    ## Or
    make all

If you have not worked with $TEXMFHOME you might want to refer to the
documentation of your TeX distribution for details. See also the next section.

  IMPORTANT NOTES REGARDING TDS

Please note that the images/ and the license-texts/ subdirectories must end up in the runtime tex/
subtree (that is tex/latex/doclicense/) for the \doclicenseImage macro and the \doclicense*FullText macros to work
correctly.
